# Problem-solving-Agents-using-Search-Algorithms
The purpose of this project is to implement a problem-solving agent using a search algorithm. I will implement three different strategies: breadthfirst search, depth-first search and Aâˆ—. Given a problem, your implementation will indicate whether there is a solution from the initial state to the goal state. When a solution exists, the program will indicate, for each strategy, all the steps taken, the states that have been visited and the ones that have been considered for examination.
